Added a url handler to streamline settingup/adding accounts, following are some sample URLs:

This is the defaults setup by the app when it is first installed:
freshdocs://add-account?username=iphone&password=c4ntgu3ssm3&host=demo.ziaconsulting.com&port=80&protocol=http&webapp=/alfresco/service/api/cmis

This will connect to freshstart so you can test uploading, etc:
freshdocs://add-account?username=admin&password=demopw&host=freshstart.ziaconsulting.com&port=80&protocol=http&webapp=/alfresco/service/cmis

And this is like the previous but sets all of the flags to YES rather than their default value of NO:
freshdocs://add-account?username=admin&password=demopw&host=freshstart.ziaconsulting.com&port=80&protocol=http&webapp=/alfresco/service/cmis&showCompanyHome=True&showHidden=True&fullTextSearch=Yes

Note that if username and or password are not provided they default to blank rather than the value provided in the settings bundle.

Also note that this customization works for the first urlScheme defined in the application info.plist file. As such each branded version can have a different url scheme.
